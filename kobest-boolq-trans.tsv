Empiricism is a theory in philosophy that emphasizes knowledge derived from evidence obtained through sensory experience. It contrasts with rationalism, which seeks to pursue the source of knowledge solely in reason. Empiricism is also the most widely accepted perspective in epistemology, the study of human knowledge. In empiricism, the emphasis is on perception through experience and evidence, particularly through senses, rather than innate concepts or customs, in the process of forming concepts. In the same context, empiricism in the philosophy of science emphasizes perspectives that are closely related to evidence, particularly those based on experimentation.	Does rationalism emphasize experience rather than tradition?	0
Postmodernism, also known as postmodernity or post-modernism, generally refers to a comprehensive movement in Western society, culture, and art that has deviated from modernism.

Did postmodernism emerge before World War II?	0
Deductive inference is a logical term that refers to the process of deriving a conclusion based on premises. Unlike inductive reasoning, which considers the possibility of truth, deductive reasoning examines the relationship between propositions and logical validity. In other words, deductive inference can lead to a conclusion with absolute necessity based on the premises.	If a conclusion is derived based on assumptions, is it deductive reasoning?	1
Inductive reasoning or induction is a method of reasoning in which general conclusions are drawn from specific individual facts or phenomena. Induction is a process that leads from observations obtained as specific facts or phenomena to general knowledge about the whole, and it is a way of thinking that generalizes the results of human experience, practice, experimentation, etc. Unlike deductive reasoning in logic, it extends factual knowledge, but it has the limitation that premises do not logically establish the necessity of the conclusion.	Does induction reasoning lead to conclusions based on specific special facts?	1
In epistemology, rationalism, rationalism or intellectualism refers to the belief that reason is the ultimate source of knowledge. In rationalism, the criterion of truth is defined by rational and deductive methodologies or theories, rather than sensory perceptions. Rationalists argue that there is a method by which our concepts and knowledge are obtained independently from sensory experience, while empiricists argue that sensory experience is the ultimate source of our concepts and knowledge.	Do rationalists consider reason as the source of knowledge?	1
"Kant emphasized the motive of an action rather than its consequence. He presented the moral law as an ""unconditional command"" where the command itself is the purpose, rather than a means to obtain a result or achieve a goal."	Did Kant prioritize results more than motives?	0
"René Descartes is known as a French philosopher, mathematician, scientist, father of modern philosophy, and the founder of analytic geometry.

To ensure the stability of workers' lives and improve the quality of the workforce, each country establishes a minimum wage according to its own laws and regulations.	Is the minimum wage determined by the employer?	0
Monetary neutrality refers to the concept that changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables of the economy, such as prices, wages, and exchange rates, and have no impact on real variables such as employment, real GDP, and real consumption. Monetary neutrality is an important idea in classical economics and is related to the classical dichotomy. It indicates that the central bank's creation of money does not affect the real economy (e.g., the number of jobs, the size of real GDP, real investment).	Does monetary neutrality mean that changes in the money supply do not affect real GDP?	1
Enterprise value (EV), total enterprise value (TEV), or firm value (FV) is an economic measure that reflects the market value of a company.

Feathers are not uniformly distributed on the skin of birds, except for several groups such as penguins, ostriches, and ducks. In most birds, feathers grow from a specific skin called the feather follicle, and there are areas without feathers called apteria in between. Feather-like feathers or downy feathers grow in these apteria. The arrangement of these feathers varies depending on the species of bird and has been used as a means to determine the evolutionary relationship with past birds, according to the study of feather distribution or feather morphology.	Does the arrangement of feathers vary depending on the bird?	1
A floating island refers to a small land that looks like a small island formed by the accumulation of water plants or aquatic plants from centimeters to meters thick.

"Although crocodiles have heavy bodies and slow metabolism, they can make momentary dashes like charging. The main prey of crocodiles are small animals that can be killed and eaten in one bite. They can also catch large prey and drag them into the water to drown them. Crocodiles either wait for the wounds of the prey that cannot be eaten in one bite to rot, or they bite and tear them until they are the size of one bite. This is called a ""death roll."" The crucial factor for a crocodile to perform a death roll is that its tail must be bent at a considerable angle compared to its body. A crocodile with a tail that does not move cannot perform a death roll."	Can an alligator play dead even if it can't move its tail?	0
The comb or crest is the fleshy part on the head of birds belonging to the chicken order, such as turkeys, pheasants, and domestic chickens. Combs are generally larger in males than in females.

The lost portion is converted to retinal in the blood and supplied.	Is vitamin A deficiency common in developed countries?	0
Ground subsidence, also known as a sinkhole, refers to the phenomenon where the earth's surface sinks or forms holes or large puddles for various reasons. It occurs not only in urban areas but also in agricultural land, plains, and mountainous areas, due to the diverse occurrence regions and soil properties. Depending on the cause of ground subsidence, the size can range from around 1 meter to over 100 meters in diameter. The depth can vary from simple holes or puddles of around 1 meter to cliffs or pits that extend for tens of meters.	Does sinkhole only occur in urban areas?	0
Cutaneous respiration is a type of respiration in which gas exchange occurs through the skin or outer covering, rather than through the lungs or gills. Cutaneous respiration can occur solely through gas exchange or may involve other forms. For example, earthworms absorb oxygen from the air through their moist skin and release carbon dioxide. Similarly, frogs assist pulmonary respiration by engaging in cutaneous respiration through their moist skin.	Does skin respiration occur through the lungs or gills?	0
The Maxwell's equations are four partial differential equations that represent the generation of electricity and magnetism, electric and magnetic fields, and the formation of charge density and current density. The Maxwell's equations also demonstrate that light is also one of the electromagnetic waves. Each equation is called Gauss's law, Gauss's law for magnetism, Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, and Ampere's law. After James Clerk Maxwell synthesized each equation, they became known as the Maxwell's equations.	The Maxwell equations were formulated by James Clerk Maxwell.	1
The double-slit experiment is an experiment in quantum mechanics that distinguishes the wave-like and particle-like nature of the experiment subject. When the experiment subject is passed through the double-slit apparatus, the result value differs depending on whether it is a wave or a particle. Waves have the properties of diffraction and interference. Therefore, when waves pass through both slits, diffraction and interference occur, and an interference pattern appears on the back screen. On the other hand, particles do not have these characteristics, so no interference pattern appears. By distinguishing between these two differences, the experiment material is determined to be either a particle or a wave.	The double slit experiment is not related to quantum mechanics.	0
Among the three types of nuclear energy generation, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, and radioactive decay, the method currently used in nuclear power generation is nuclear fission. Nuclear fusion is still in the research stage, and nuclear energy generated by radioactive decay is difficult to directly use for power generation as the quantity is relatively small. Therefore, nuclear power generation is carried out by artificially splitting radioactive materials such as uranium in a reactor to produce atomic energy.	Do you currently mainly use nuclear fusion for nuclear power generation?	0
CAD is widely used in the design of tools or machines used in part manufacturing. CAD is also used in all forms of architectural design, ranging from systems or small residential forms (houses) to large commercial or industrial structures (hospitals and factories).

When building a building, the foundation under the building must be able to support the weight of the building so that the structure does not collapse. Before starting construction, the properties of the ground are assessed and, if necessary, the ground is reinforced using separate methods. Civil engineering knowledge and experience in soil mechanics and foundation engineering are used for this purpose. If a structure is built on improperly treated ground, the ground may sink or move horizontally depending on the situation. A structure installed on unstable ground cannot be used no matter how strong it is built.	Can the ground sink when a structure is raised?	1
Genetically modified organisms are organisms that have been altered by inserting genes from another organism into the existing organism, giving it new traits that it did not originally possess. They are primarily produced by modifying and manipulating genes to increase productivity and improve product quality. All organisms have genetic information called DNA. Based on this genetic information, each organ of an organism is formed and functions, so DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) can be considered as the basic element of life.	Does genetic modification have nothing to do with productivity improvement?	0
Batteries can be modeled as voltage sources using series resistance. In reality, the internal resistance of a battery varies depending on the battery size, chemical characteristics, age, temperature, and current.
